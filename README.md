# Event Search

# Overview
Project1 is a team project; team members are Janelle, Kurtis, myself, and Steve (and can be found on the collaborators listing). Our project is called EventSearch and is an app that will search for events in a given city, from concerts to sports to kids' shows. The user can search without creating an account, but account creation will enable the user to save their search results and to login/out securely. Upon successful account creation, a success page is displayed. The "saved" events page is only displayed to users who have created an account. The app is simple and clean, with as little distraction as possible.
